-- How To Run --

-- INSTALLATION: --

1. Install NodeJS - make sure you install npm with it!
2. Open your shell of choice ('CMD' on Windows, 'bash' on most Linux distros, etc etc)
3. Navigate to this folder (if you cloned this, that should be easy enough to do)
4. Run 'npm install' - this downloads the CSV package.

-- RUNNING: --

Simply run 'node "BULBASAUR.js"' or 'node "BULBASAUR NO HUMANS.js"' in your shell of choice. It's a near 1-1 of Austin's python code, but cleaned up... and then made messy again... Don't sue me.
